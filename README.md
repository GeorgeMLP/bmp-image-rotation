# BMP Image Rotation

This programme rotates a **24-bit true colour** bitmap image by 90 degrees clockwise. 

First, compile the ```cpp``` file to ```exe``` file named ```rotatebmp.exe```. Then, run this programme from command line using the following command:

```
rotatebmp src.bmp dest.bmp
```

where ```src.bmp``` is the image to be rotated and ```dest.bmp``` is the name of the image after rotation.
